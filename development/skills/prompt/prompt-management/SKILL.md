# Prompt Management

Store, retrieve, search, and track prompts in the Team Prompt Library Notion database. Used by: `/founder-os:prompt:list` (search and filter), `/founder-os:prompt:get` (retrieve a single prompt by name), `/founder-os:prompt:add` (store a new prompt), `/founder-os:prompt:share` (change visibility to Shared), and `/founder-os:prompt:optimize` (read prompt content before optimization).

## Purpose and Context

Manage a central library of reusable prompts that a founder and their team can save, discover, and apply across their workflows. Every prompt is stored in Notion with consistent metadata: category, variables, visibility, usage tracking, author, and tags. The Notion database is the single source of truth. All five commands operate against the same database and share the same read/write patterns defined in this skill.

## Notion Database

**Database name**: Search for `[FOS] Prompts` first, then fall back to `Founder OS HQ - Prompts`, then `Team Prompt Library - Prompts`.

Use dynamic database discovery: search the workspace for a database titled "[FOS] Prompts". If not found, try "Founder OS HQ - Prompts". If not found, fall back to "Team Prompt Library - Prompts". If none is found, report: "Prompts database not found. Ensure the Founder OS HQ workspace template is installed in your Notion workspace, or run the plugin setup." Do not create the database automatically.

### Schema

| Property | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Name | title | Primary key. Case-insensitive uniqueness enforced on upsert. |
| Content | rich_text | Full prompt text including `{{variable}}` placeholders. |
| Category | select | One of the 6 predefined categories or a custom value. |
| Variables | rich_text | Comma-separated list of detected variable names, e.g. `client_name, tone, deadline`. |
| Visibility | select | `Personal` or `Shared`. Default: `Personal`. |
| Times Used | number | Integer counter. Starts at 0. Incremented on each `/founder-os:prompt:get`. |
| Author | rich_text | Name or identifier of the person who added the prompt. |
| Tags | multi_select | Freeform tags for cross-category discoverability. |
| Created At | date | ISO 8601 timestamp set on creation. Never overwritten. |
| Last Used | date | ISO 8601 timestamp updated on each `/founder-os:prompt:get`. |

### Idempotent Upsert Rule

When adding or updating a prompt, search the database for a page whose `Name` matches the target name (case-insensitive). If a match exists, update the existing page rather than creating a new one. If no match exists, create a new page. This prevents duplicate entries when the same prompt is added more than once.

---

## Prompt Categories

Six predefined categories cover the most common use cases. Accept any custom category string when the predefined options do not fit.

| Category | Typical Use Cases |
|----------|--------------------|
| Email Templates | Client outreach, follow-ups, cold intros, status updates |
| Meeting Prompts | Agenda setting, prep briefs, recap writing, talking points |
| Analysis Prompts | Data interpretation, competitor review, financial summary |
| Content Creation | Blog drafts, LinkedIn posts, newsletter sections, social copy |
| Code Assistance | Code review, debugging guidance, documentation generation |
| Research Prompts | Market research, literature summaries, fact-finding briefs |

When the user provides a category that does not match any predefined option exactly, accept it as a custom category and store it verbatim as the `Category` select value. Notion will create a new select option automatically. Do not reject or correct custom categories -- the schema is intentionally open.

If no category is provided, infer the most likely category from the prompt content using the table above. When inference is ambiguous, default to `Research Prompts` and note the assumption.

---

## Variable Syntax and Detection

Prompts support `{{variable}}` placeholders that the user fills in before running the prompt. Use double curly braces with no spaces inside.

### Detection Regex

```
\{\{([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*)\}\}
```

This pattern matches `{{variable_name}}` where the variable name starts with a letter or underscore and contains only alphanumeric characters and underscores.

### Detection Rules

- Extract all unique variable names from the prompt's `Content` field at the time the prompt is stored or updated.
- Deduplicate variable names (case-insensitive deduplication -- `{{ClientName}}` and `{{clientname}}` are the same variable).
- Store the deduplicated variable names as a comma-separated string in the `Variables` property.
- If no variables are detected, store an empty string in `Variables`.

### Variable Naming Conventions

Encourage (but do not enforce) these naming conventions when helping users write prompts:

- Use `snake_case` for multi-word names: `{{client_name}}`, `{{tone_of_voice}}`, `{{deadline_date}}`
- Use descriptive names, not positional ones: `{{company_name}}` not `{{var1}}`
- Use `_date` suffix for dates: `{{report_date}}`, `{{meeting_date}}`
- Use `_list` suffix for lists: `{{key_topics_list}}`, `{{attendees_list}}`

When displaying a prompt with variables to the user (e.g., in `/founder-os:prompt:get`), list the variables separately so the user knows exactly what to fill in before running the prompt.

---

## Visibility Model

Every prompt has one of two visibility states:

| State | Meaning | Who Can See It |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| Personal | Private to the author | Only the user running the command |
| Shared | Available to the whole team | All workspace members |

### Default Behavior

- All new prompts default to `Personal` unless the user specifies otherwise at creation time or uses `/founder-os:prompt:share`.
- The `/founder-os:prompt:list` command shows Personal prompts and Shared prompts together, since Claude Code operates in a single-user context. Make no attempt to filter by author identity.
- The `/founder-os:prompt:share` command changes `Visibility` from `Personal` to `Shared`. Never change `Shared` back to `Personal` without explicit user instruction.

---

## Prompt Naming Conventions

Prompt names must be unique (enforced by the idempotent upsert rule). Encourage these naming patterns when the user does not supply a name:

- Format: `[Audience/Context] [Action] [Object]`
- Examples: `Client Intro Email`, `Weekly Status Update`, `Competitor Analysis Brief`, `Code Review Checklist`
- Keep names under 60 characters for readability in list views.
- Use Title Case for all prompt names.
- Avoid generic names like `Email` or `My Prompt` -- they are unsearchable and collision-prone.

When the user adds a prompt without providing a name, infer a name from the first sentence or purpose of the prompt content. Confirm the inferred name before saving.

## Search and Filter Logic (for /founder-os:prompt:list)

The `/founder-os:prompt:list` command searches and filters the Notion database. Apply filters in this order:

### 1. Category Filter

If `--category` is specified, return only prompts where `Category` matches the specified value (case-insensitive). Accept partial matches: `--category=email` matches `Email Templates`.

### 2. Visibility Filter

If `--shared` is specified, return only prompts where `Visibility` is `Shared`.
If `--personal` is specified, return only prompts where `Visibility` is `Personal`.
If neither flag is provided, return all prompts regardless of visibility.

### 3. Tag Filter

If `--tag` is specified, return only prompts where `Tags` contains the specified tag (case-insensitive).

### 4. Text Search

If a search query is provided, filter results to prompts where the `Name`, `Tags`, or `Content` contains the query string. Apply text search after category, visibility, and tag filters.

### 5. Sort Order

Default sort: `Times Used` descending (most-used prompts first). This surfaces the most valuable prompts at the top.

When `--recent` is specified, sort by `Created At` descending (newest first) instead.

### 6. Limit

Apply a default limit of 20 results unless `--limit=N` is specified. Never return more than 50 results in a single list response.

### Display Format for List Results

Show results as a numbered list with this information per prompt:

```
N. [Name] — [Category]
   Variables: {{var1}}, {{var2}}  |  Used: X times  |  Visibility: Personal/Shared
   Tags: tag1, tag2
```

If no results match the filters, report the active filters and suggest broader search terms or removing a filter.

---

## Usage Tracking

Track prompt usage to surface the most valuable prompts and provide usage analytics.

### On /founder-os:prompt:get

Every time a prompt is retrieved via `/founder-os:prompt:get`:
1. Increment the `Times Used` counter by 1.
2. Set `Last Used` to the current date (ISO 8601, date-only: `YYYY-MM-DD`).

Perform these updates as part of the same Notion page update call that retrieves the prompt content. Do not skip tracking even if the user is just "browsing" -- a retrieval is a retrieval.

### On /founder-os:prompt:list

Do not increment `Times Used` when listing prompts. List is a browse operation, not a usage event.

### On /founder-os:prompt:add or /founder-os:prompt:share

Do not modify `Times Used` or `Last Used` on add or share operations.

---

## Edge Cases and Guardrails

### Duplicate Name Handling

If a user attempts to add a prompt with a name that already exists (case-insensitive match), do not silently overwrite. Present the existing prompt and ask whether to overwrite (update content, category, and tags) or save under a different name. Never create a second entry with an identical name.

### Empty or Minimal Prompts

Reject prompts with fewer than 10 characters of content. Prompts this short are likely errors or placeholders. Ask the user to provide the full prompt text.

### Category Not Found

If the user filters by `--category=X` and no prompts exist in that category, report the empty result explicitly: "No prompts found in category 'X'. Available categories: [list current categories from DB]." Fetch the current category list from the database's select property options rather than hardcoding the predefined list -- custom categories may have been added.

### Variable Extraction on Update

When a prompt's `Content` is updated, re-run variable extraction and overwrite the `Variables` field with the new result. Do not append to the existing Variables list.

### Large Content

Notion's `rich_text` property supports up to 2000 characters per block. If a prompt's `Content` exceeds 2000 characters, split the content across multiple rich_text blocks in the same property, or warn the user that the prompt may be truncated and suggest shortening it or storing the full version as a Notion page child block.

### Graceful Degradation

If the Notion CLI is unavailable, report the error clearly and fall back to displaying prompt output in chat only (for `/founder-os:prompt:get`) or listing nothing (for `/founder-os:prompt:list`). Never invent prompt content or fabricate search results when the database cannot be reached.
