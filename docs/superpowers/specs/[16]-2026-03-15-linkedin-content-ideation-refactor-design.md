# Content Ideation Namespace Refactor — Design Specification

**Date**: 2026-03-15
**Status**: Draft
**Namespace**: `ideate` (replacing `linkedin`)
**Spec Number**: [16]
**Depends On**: [10] Social Media Posting, [15] Social Content Template Engine
**Related**: This spec refactors the `linkedin` namespace (P24) into a broadened `ideate` namespace for multi-platform content ideation, removing publishing responsibility to the `social` namespace.

## Overview

Rename the `linkedin` namespace to `ideate` and broaden it from LinkedIn-only content generation to multi-platform ideation covering LinkedIn, X/Twitter, Meta (Facebook + Instagram), and TikTok. Publishing, formatting, and platform-specific adaptation move entirely to the `social` namespace ([10], [15]).

The `ideate` namespace becomes a pure **content ideation layer**: raw content generation, topic research, document extraction, structured outlines, and fact gathering. Its output feeds into `social:compose` for template application and `social:post` for publishing.

## Goals

1. **Clean separation**: Ideation (thinking) vs composition (formatting) vs publishing (posting) are three distinct layers
2. **Multi-platform**: Ideation output is platform-aware but not platform-formatted — guidance on what works where, without locking into a specific format
3. **Composable pipeline**: Each command is independently useful; users can enter at any point
4. **Zero publishing dependency**: No Late.dev API calls, no Notion Content DB writes from this namespace
5. **Skill reuse**: Generalized skills serve all platforms from a single source of truth

## Architecture

### Layer Separation

| Layer | Namespace | Responsibility |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **Ideation & Research** | `ideate` | Raw content generation, topic research, document extraction, outlines, fact gathering, angle variations |
| **Composition** | `social` | Template-driven formatting, technique application, A/B testing, platform-specific adaptation |
| **Publishing** | `social` | Posting, scheduling, monitoring, analytics via Late.dev |

### Components

```

      └── references/voice-examples.md         # Before/after examples (all platforms)
```

### Data Flow (Target State)

```
ideate:research "freelancing" --platforms=linkedin,x
    → web search for trends, stats, competitor angles
    → outputs research brief with 3-5 ranked angles

ideate:facts quarterly-report.pdf
    → extracts stats, quotes, data points
    → outputs classified fact list (hook-worthy, supporting, credibility)

ideate:outline "freelancing vs employment" --framework=contrarian --platform=linkedin
    → generates skeleton: hook options, body beats, closer options

ideate:draft "freelancing vs employment" --platform=linkedin --framework=contrarian
    → uses founder voice, content-writing skill
    → outputs content brief (not platform-formatted)

social:compose "content brief" --technique=reversal --platform=linkedin
    → applies template from [15] engine, formats for platform
    → outputs ready-to-post content

social:post "content" --platforms=linkedin,x
    → publishes via Late.dev
```

Each step is independent — users can enter at any point. `ideate:research` into `ideate:draft` is a natural flow but not required.

## Commands

All commands follow the universal execution flow from the existing namespace conventions (Business Context, Preflight, Memory Context, Intelligence, Phases, Self-Healing, Observation Logging, Memory Update).

All command `.md` files include standard YAML frontmatter per Founder OS conventions.

### Modified Commands

#### `ideate:draft` (was `linkedin:post`)

Generate raw content from a topic with framework selection, audience targeting, and founder voice.

```yaml
---
description: Generate raw content from a topic with framework selection, audience targeting, and founder voice
argument-hint: "[topic] [--platform=linkedin|x|meta|tiktok] [--audience=founder|technical|marketer|cxo] [--framework=story|listicle|contrarian|howto|lesson|insight|question] [--length=short|medium|long] [--to-file=PATH]"
allowed-tools: ["Read", "Write"]
execution-mode: background
result-format: summary
---
```

**Arguments:**

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `topic` | Yes | — | Topic or idea for the content (positional) |
| `--platform` | No | linkedin | Target platform for length/style calibration |
| `--audience` | No | founder | Target reader segment |
| `--framework` | No | auto | Post structure framework (story, listicle, contrarian, howto, lesson, insight, question) |
| `--length` | No | medium | Content length mode (short, medium, long) |
| `--to-file` | No | — | Save output to file path (otherwise ephemeral in chat) |
| `--tone` | No | professional | Humanization tone preset |

**Key changes from `linkedin:post`:**
- Removes Notion Content DB integration (no more upsert to `[FOS] Content`)
- Removes default file output to `linkedin-posts/` directory (ephemeral by default, `--to-file` optional)
- Adds `--platform` flag (linkedin, x, meta, tiktok) to calibrate length/style guidance
- Output is a **content brief** — structured text with framework, key points, hook candidates, and body text — not a platform-formatted post
- Keeps the 3-phase structure (Ideation, Draft, Validate) but Phase 3 drops platform formatting checks and hashtag generation
- Skills loaded: `content-writing`, `hook-creation`, `founder-voice` (generalized versions from `skills/ideate/`)

**Execution flow:**

1. **Phase 1 — Ideation**: Framework selection (same logic as linkedin:post), hook generation (3 candidates), key points identification, audience calibration. Platform awareness influences framework selection (e.g., TikTok favors pattern-interrupt, X favors contrarian).
2. **Phase 2 — Draft**: Write content brief using selected framework structure. Apply founder voice. Platform-aware length guidance but no platform-specific formatting (no hashtags, no character limit enforcement beyond reasonable bounds).
3. **Phase 3 — Validate and Output**: Quality checklist from content-writing skill (generalized). Display content brief with metadata. Include "Next step" suggestion: `Run /social:compose "..." --platform=<platform> to format and publish`.

**Output format:**

```
## Content Brief

- **Topic**: [topic]
- **Framework**: [selected framework]
- **Audience**: [target segment]
- **Platform hint**: [platform]
- **Length**: [mode] ([character count] characters)

### Hook Candidates
1. [hook] ← selected
2. [hook]
3. [hook]

### Content

[Raw content body in founder voice — structured by framework but not platform-formatted]

---
Next step: Run /social:compose "..." --platform=<platform> to format and publish.
```

#### `ideate:from-doc` (modified from `linkedin:from-doc`)

Extract content angles from documents for multi-platform ideation.

```yaml
---
description: Extract key points from a document and generate content angles for social media
argument-hint: "[file-path-or-paste] [--platform=linkedin|x|meta|tiktok] [--platforms=linkedin,x,tiktok] [--audience=founder|technical|marketer|cxo] [--framework=auto|story|listicle|contrarian|howto|lesson|insight|question] [--to-file=PATH]"
allowed-tools: ["Read", "Write"]
execution-mode: background
result-format: summary
---
```

**Key changes from `linkedin:from-doc`:**
- Same extraction pipeline (Phase 1) but output is ideation material, not a formatted post
- Adds `--platform` flag for platform-aware angle selection (TikTok favors visual/action angles, X favors punchy contrarian takes, Meta favors storytelling)
- Adds `--platforms` (plural) to extract angles for multiple platforms in one pass
- Removes Notion logging and default file output
- Phase 2 generates a content brief, not a finished post
- No hashtag generation

**Execution flow:**

1. **Phase 1 — Extract**: Read source, identify document type, extract 3-7 key points with supporting details, identify strongest angle. Platform awareness influences angle ranking (e.g., data-heavy angles rank higher for LinkedIn, visual/action angles for TikTok).
2. **Phase 2 — Draft**: Generate content brief using the strongest angle. If `--platforms` specified, generate separate angle recommendations per platform.
3. **Phase 3 — Output**: Display content brief with source attribution. Suggest next step.

#### `ideate:variations` (modified from `linkedin:variations`)

Generate multiple angle variations from a topic or existing draft.

```yaml
---
description: Generate multiple content angle variations with different hooks, frameworks, and tones
argument-hint: "[draft-or-topic] [--platform=linkedin|x|meta|tiktok] [--audience=founder|technical|marketer|cxo] [--count=3]"
allowed-tools: ["Read"]
execution-mode: background
result-format: summary
---
```

**Key changes from `linkedin:variations`:**
- Adds `--platform` to vary output style guidance per platform
- Variations are ideation-level (different angles, hooks, frameworks) not platform-formatted posts
- Can generate cross-platform variations when used with different `--platform` values
- Remains ephemeral (no file output, no Notion) — unchanged from original

**Execution flow:** Same as `linkedin:variations` but outputs content briefs instead of formatted posts. Each variation uses a different framework + hook formula + tone shift. Display comparison table at end.

### New Commands

#### `ideate:research`

Research a topic for content angles using web search, trend analysis, and competitor content analysis.

```yaml
---
description: Research a topic for content angles — web search, trend analysis, competitor content
argument-hint: "[topic] [--platforms=linkedin,x,meta,tiktok] [--depth=quick|deep]"
allowed-tools: ["Read", "WebSearch", "WebFetch"]
execution-mode: background
result-format: full
---
```

**Arguments:**

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `topic` | Yes | — | Topic to research (positional) |
| `--platforms` | No | linkedin | Target platforms for angle scoring |
| `--depth` | No | quick | Research depth: quick (3-5 searches) or deep (8-12 searches + competitor analysis) |

**Execution flow:**

1. **Phase 1 — Topic Analysis**: Break topic into searchable dimensions — industry angle, contrarian angle, data angle, trend angle, personal experience angle.
2. **Phase 2 — Web Research**: Search for recent articles, statistics, competitor posts, trending discussions on the topic. Quick mode: 3-5 targeted searches. Deep mode: 8-12 searches across different dimensions + competitor content analysis.
3. **Phase 3 — Angle Generation**: Synthesize 3-5 content angles from research. For each angle: hook idea, 2-3 supporting data points, platform fit score (which platforms this angle works best on), framework recommendation.
4. **Phase 4 — Output**: Structured research brief with angles ranked by engagement potential per platform. Include source URLs for fact-checking.

**Output format:**

```
## Research Brief: [topic]

**Depth**: [quick|deep]
**Sources consulted**: [count]

### Angle 1: [title] ★ Best for: LinkedIn, X
**Hook idea**: [one-line hook]
**Supporting data**:
- [stat or fact with source]
- [stat or fact with source]
**Framework**: [recommended framework]
**Why it works**: [one sentence]

### Angle 2: [title] ★ Best for: TikTok, Meta
...

---
Next step: Run /ideate:draft "[selected angle]" --platform=<platform> to generate content.
```

#### `ideate:outline`

Generate a structured content outline from a topic or brief.

```yaml
---
description: Generate a structured content outline from a topic or brief
argument-hint: "[topic-or-brief] [--framework=story|listicle|contrarian|howto|lesson|insight|question] [--platform=linkedin|x|meta|tiktok] [--depth=skeleton|detailed]"
allowed-tools: ["Read"]
execution-mode: background
result-format: summary
---
```

**Arguments:**

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `topic-or-brief` | Yes | — | Topic, research brief output, or pasted text (positional) |
| `--framework` | No | auto | Structure framework |
| `--platform` | No | linkedin | Platform for length/structure guidance |
| `--depth` | No | skeleton | Outline depth: skeleton (headings + one-liners) or detailed (full beat-by-beat) |

**Execution flow:**

1. **Phase 1 — Structure Selection**: If `--framework=auto`, analyze topic and select best framework. Consider platform — X outlines are tighter (thread structure), TikTok outlines emphasize opening hook and CTA.
2. **Phase 2 — Outline Generation**:
   - **Skeleton mode**: Hook options (2-3), body section headings with one-line descriptions, closer options (2-3).
   - **Detailed mode**: Full beat-by-beat outline with: multiple hook candidates, body sections with bullet points per beat, transition notes between sections, closer options with audience-specific variants.
3. **Phase 3 — Output**: Display outline with framework label and platform guidance notes.

#### `ideate:facts`

Extract facts, statistics, and quotable data from documents or URLs for content backing.

```yaml
---
description: Extract facts, statistics, and quotable data from documents or URLs for content backing
argument-hint: "[file-path-or-url] [--format=bullets|table] [--max=10]"
allowed-tools: ["Read", "WebFetch"]
execution-mode: background
result-format: full
---
```

**Arguments:**

| Argument | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `source` | Yes | — | File path or URL (positional) |
| `--format` | No | bullets | Output format: bullets or table |
| `--max` | No | 10 | Maximum facts to extract |

**Execution flow:**

1. **Phase 1 — Source Loading**: Read document file or fetch URL content. Supported: `.md`, `.txt`, `.pdf` (via Read tool), URLs (via WebFetch).
2. **Phase 2 — Fact Extraction**: Pull out statistics with sources, quotable statements, data points, trend indicators, counterintuitive findings.
3. **Phase 3 — Classification**: Tag each fact by content role:
   - **Hook-worthy**: Surprising stats or counterintuitive findings that could open a post
   - **Body-supporting**: Evidence and examples that back up a claim
   - **Credibility-building**: Authoritative sources, named studies, expert quotes
4. **Phase 4 — Output**: Structured list with source attribution, classification tags, and suggested use context. Ready to inject into `ideate:draft` or `social:compose`.

## Skills

### Skill Migration

| New Skill | From | Scope Change |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `skills/ideate/content-writing/SKILL.md` | `skills/linkedin/linkedin-writing/SKILL.md` | Add platform sections for X, Meta (FB + IG), TikTok. Keep LinkedIn section intact. Generalize framework selection logic. |
| `skills/ideate/hook-creation/SKILL.md` | `skills/linkedin/hook-creation/SKILL.md` | Add platform-specific hook guidance for X, Meta, TikTok. Keep LinkedIn hook rules intact. |
| `skills/ideate/founder-voice/SKILL.md` | `skills/linkedin/founder-voice/SKILL.md` | Add platform tone calibration notes. Core voice principles unchanged. |

### Platform Coverage in Skills

Each generalized skill gets platform-specific sections:

| Platform | Content-Writing Focus | Hook Focus | Voice Calibration |
|----------|----------------------|------------|-------------------|
| **LinkedIn** | 3000 char, line breaks, no markdown, 3-5 hashtags at end, professional formatting | 210 char fold, curiosity gap, 6 proven formulas | Professional-conversational, opinionated |
| **X/Twitter** | 280 char per tweet, thread structure, 1-2 inline hashtags, plain text only | < 50 char punchy, pattern interrupt, contrarian lead | Casual-punchy, contrarian, direct |
| **Meta (FB)** | 500 char sweet spot, visual-first, link in comments, storytelling format | Emotional resonance, identification, visual context hooks | Warm-personal, storytelling, relatable |
| **Meta (IG)** | 2200 char caption, visual context required, 20-30 hashtags in comment, first line = scroll-stop | Visual hook reference, first line critical, behind-the-scenes tone | Authentic, behind-the-scenes, lifestyle |
| **TikTok** | 150 char caption, trend hooks, CTA in caption, hashtag challenges | Pattern interrupt, trend reference, first 3 words decisive | Direct, trend-aware, Gen-Z adaptable, high energy |

### Skill Frontmatter Updates

All three skills update their `globs` to target the new namespace:

```yaml
---
globs:
  - "commands/ideate/*.md"
---
```

### Reference Files

Each skill's `references/` directory is carried over from the linkedin skills and expanded:

- `content-writing/references/post-frameworks.md` — Framework templates expanded with platform-specific variants (e.g., X thread structure for Listicle, TikTok script structure for How-To)
- `hook-creation/references/hook-templates.md` — Hook examples expanded with X, Meta, TikTok examples alongside LinkedIn
- `founder-voice/references/voice-examples.md` — Before/after rewrite examples expanded to show platform tone shifts

## Removed Responsibilities

The `ideate` namespace does NOT:

- Call Late.dev API (no publishing, scheduling, or status tracking)
- Write to Notion Content DB (no `[FOS] Content` upsert)
- Apply platform-specific formatting (no hashtags, no character limit enforcement, no thread splitting)
- Handle media upload
- Generate default file output (ephemeral unless `--to-file` specified)

These responsibilities belong to the `social` namespace.

## Migration

### Clean Break

The `linkedin` namespace is removed entirely. No deprecation aliases, no redirect commands. Users adopt the new `ideate` namespace and `social` pipeline.

### Deleted Files

| Path | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `commands/linkedin/post.md` | Replaced by `commands/ideate/draft.md` |
| `commands/linkedin/from-doc.md` | Replaced by `commands/ideate/from-doc.md` |
| `commands/linkedin/variations.md` | Replaced by `commands/ideate/variations.md` |
| `skills/linkedin/linkedin-writing/SKILL.md` | Replaced by `skills/ideate/content-writing/SKILL.md` |
| `skills/linkedin/linkedin-writing/references/post-frameworks.md` | Moves to `skills/ideate/content-writing/references/` |
| `skills/linkedin/hook-creation/SKILL.md` | Replaced by `skills/ideate/hook-creation/SKILL.md` |
| `skills/linkedin/hook-creation/references/hook-templates.md` | Moves to `skills/ideate/hook-creation/references/` |
| `skills/linkedin/founder-voice/SKILL.md` | Replaced by `skills/ideate/founder-voice/SKILL.md` |
| `skills/linkedin/founder-voice/references/voice-examples.md` | Moves to `skills/ideate/founder-voice/references/` |

### New Files

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `commands/ideate/draft.md` | Content brief generation (replaces linkedin:post) |
| `commands/ideate/from-doc.md` | Document-to-content extraction |
| `commands/ideate/variations.md` | Angle variations |
| `commands/ideate/research.md` | Topic research with web search |
| `commands/ideate/outline.md` | Structural outlines |
| `commands/ideate/facts.md` | Fact/stat extraction |
| `skills/ideate/content-writing/SKILL.md` | Generalized writing skill (LinkedIn + X + Meta + TikTok) |
| `skills/ideate/content-writing/references/post-frameworks.md` | Framework templates (all platforms) |
| `skills/ideate/hook-creation/SKILL.md` | Generalized hook skill |
| `skills/ideate/hook-creation/references/hook-templates.md` | Hook templates (all platforms) |
| `skills/ideate/founder-voice/SKILL.md` | Generalized voice skill |
| `skills/ideate/founder-voice/references/voice-examples.md` | Voice examples (all platforms) |

### Modified Files

| Path | Change |
|------|--------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Replace `linkedin` row (#24) with `ideate` — 6 commands, WebSearch (research only), no HQ DB. Update namespace count. Remove linkedin from dependency notes. |

### CLAUDE.md Namespace Table Update

Replace row #24:

```
| 24 | Content Ideation | `ideate` | draft, from-doc, variations, research, outline, facts | WebSearch (research only) | — |
```

No HQ DB dependency — ideation output is ephemeral or piped to `social:compose`.

### Preflight Check

The `ideate` namespace has minimal external dependencies:

| Dependency | Required By | Check |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| WebSearch | `research` only | Optional — if unavailable, research runs without web data and notes the limitation |

All other commands (`draft`, `from-doc`, `variations`, `outline`, `facts`) require only the Read tool and have no external dependencies. Preflight should reflect this minimal footprint.

## Development Plan

### Wave 1 (parallel subagents)

| Agent | Deliverables |
|-------|-------------|
| **Agent A — Skills** | Create 3 generalized skills from existing LinkedIn skills: `content-writing/SKILL.md`, `hook-creation/SKILL.md`, `founder-voice/SKILL.md` with platform sections for LinkedIn, X, Meta (FB + IG), TikTok. Migrate and expand reference files. |
| **Agent B — Modified Commands** | Create `commands/ideate/draft.md`, `from-doc.md`, `variations.md` adapted from linkedin originals. Remove Notion integration, add `--platform` flag, output content briefs instead of formatted posts. |

### Wave 2 (parallel subagents, after Wave 1)

| Agent | Deliverables |
|-------|-------------|
| **Agent C — New Commands** | Create `commands/ideate/research.md`, `outline.md`, `facts.md` following universal command execution flow. |
| **Agent D — Integration** | Update `CLAUDE.md` namespace table. Verify no other files reference old `linkedin` namespace paths. |

### Wave 3 (sequential, after Wave 2)

- Delete `commands/linkedin/` directory (3 files)
- Delete `skills/linkedin/` directory (3 skills + 3 reference files)
- Final verification: grep for `linkedin:post`, `linkedin:from-doc`, `linkedin:variations`, `skills/linkedin/` across the codebase

### Dependencies

```
Wave 1 (Skills + Modified Commands) — independent, parallel
Wave 2 (New Commands + Integration) — depends on Wave 1 skills existing
Wave 3 (Cleanup) — depends on all new files being in place
```

## Integration Points

### With Social Namespace ([10])

The ideate output feeds naturally into social commands:

```
ideate:draft "topic" → social:compose "content" → social:post → Late.dev
ideate:from-doc doc.pdf → social:compose "content" → social:cross-post
ideate:research "topic" → ideate:draft "angle" → social:compose → social:post
```

No code changes needed in social commands — they already accept free-text content input.

### With Template Engine ([15])

`social:compose` uses the template engine to apply rhetorical techniques. Ideate output provides the raw content that compose formats using templates:

```
ideate:draft "topic" --framework=contrarian
    → outputs raw contrarian content brief

social:compose "content brief" --technique=reversal --platform=linkedin
    → selects reversal template from [15] library
    → applies template structure to the content brief
    → formats for LinkedIn (3000 char, hashtags, line breaks)
```

### With Memory Engine

The ideate namespace participates in the existing memory system:
- **Context injection** (Step 0): Memories about brand voice, audience preferences, and past content topics are injected during ideation
- **Observation logging** (Final step): Topic selections, framework choices, and platform usage are logged as observations

## Open Questions

None — all design decisions resolved during brainstorming.
