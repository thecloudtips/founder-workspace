## Instructions

1. **Collect all proposals and analyses.** Verify that at least 2 proposals and both risk and pricing evaluations are present before proceeding. If only 2 proposals are available, proceed with 2 options and note the gap in the Provider Recommendation section.

2. **Build the scoring matrix.** For each hypothesis, extract the `overall_risk_score` (0–10 scale from risk analysis) and the pricing `score` (0–10 scale from pricing analysis). Normalize both to a 0–10 scale if needed. Apply default 50/50 weighting unless client priorities indicate otherwise (see step 2a). Compute the weighted total per hypothesis.

   **2a. Adjust dimension weights based on client priorities:**
   - Reliability-focused client ("On-time delivery", "predictability", "certainty") → weight risk 70% / pricing 30%
   - Budget-focused client ("cost", "affordable", "within budget", "price-sensitive") → weight pricing 60% / risk 40%
   - Balanced or unspecified → default 50% / 50%

   Scoring matrix format:
   ```
   | Option       | Risk Score (×weight) | Pricing Score (×weight) | Weighted Total |
   |--------------|---------------------|------------------------|----------------|
   | Conservative | 8.2 × 0.70 = 5.74   | 8.5 × 0.30 = 2.55      | 8.29           |
   | Balanced     | 7.4 × 0.70 = 5.18   | 9.0 × 0.30 = 2.70      | 7.88           |
   | Ambitious    | 5.8 × 0.70 = 4.06   | 5.5 × 0.30 = 1.65      | 5.71           |
   ```

3. **Calculate weighted totals per hypothesis.** The hypothesis with the highest weighted total is the primary recommendation candidate. Break ties by client priorities: a reliability-focused client breaks ties toward the higher risk score; a budget-focused client breaks ties toward the higher pricing score. If no stated priority exists, prefer the middle (balanced) option.

4. **Determine the recommended option.** Confirm the matrix result against client priorities stated in the brief. If the matrix winner conflicts with a clear client priority (e.g., matrix recommends ambitious but client is price-sensitive), override in favor of client priorities and document the override reasoning in the Provider Recommendation paragraph.

5. **Name each option with client-friendly descriptive names.** Do not use Conservative / Balanced / Ambitious in the final document. Apply naming patterns from the sow-writing skill: functional scope names (Foundation Package / Growth Package / Transformation Package), outcome-based names (Launch-Ready / Launch + Optimize / Full-Scale Launch), or industry-specific names. Names must signal value to the client, not internal scope sizing. Names such as Basic / Pro / Enterprise or Small / Medium / Large are not acceptable.

6. **Write the full three-option SOW document** following the sow-writing skill's three-option final document format exactly:
   - Document header: client name, provider name, date, version
   - Executive Summary (2–3 sentences covering the full engagement context)
   - Option Comparison table (per step 7 below)
   - Three full SOW sections — one per option — each containing all 10 standard sections (Header, Executive Overview, Objectives, Scope of Work, Out of Scope, Timeline and Milestones, Investment, Assumptions, Change Management, Terms). Each option must be self-contained.
   - Provider Recommendation paragraph

7. **Build the comparison table** following the sow-writing skill's comparison table rules:
   - Lead with Scope, not Investment. Place the Scope row first.
   - Row order: Scope → Timeline → Risk Profile → Investment → Best For → Recommendation indicator
   - Mark the recommended option with `✓ Recommended` in its column
   - Keep cell text to 3–8 words; save full detail for the individual option sections
   - Include a "Best For" row with client archetypes, not product attributes

8. **Add risk summaries per option** sourced from the risk analysis. Translate technical risk language into plain client language. Replace dimension scores with concrete statements: "Low — 20% buffer weeks built in and strict change control" rather than "Score: 8.2 / 10". Surface green notes from the risk analysis as selling points in the comparison table and individual option sections.

9. **Write the output file** to the path specified by `--output`. Default path if none specified: `./sow-output/sow-[client-name-kebab]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`. Replace spaces in the client name with hyphens and lowercase. Example: `./sow-output/sow-acme-corp-2026-02-24.md`. After writing, confirm the file path in the response.

   **Notion logging**: If Notion CLI is configured, follow the database discovery and record writing rules from `skills/sow-writing/SKILL.md` § Notion Tracking:

   1. Search for "[FOS] Deliverables" database first (preferred)
   2. If not found, fall back to "Founder OS HQ - Deliverables" database
   3. If not found, fall back to legacy "SOW Generator - Outputs" database
   4. If none exists, skip Notion tracking (do NOT create the database)

   When writing to "[FOS] Deliverables" or "Founder OS HQ - Deliverables":
   - Set **Type** = "SOW"
   - Set **Title** = Project name, **Status** = "Draft", **Amount** = recommended option's quoted price
   - Set **File Path** = output file path, **Brief File** = brief path if available
   - Resolve **Company** relation by looking up client name in CRM Pro "Companies" database
   - Resolve **Deal** relation if a deal was identified during context search
   - Leave Company/Deal empty if no match — never create placeholder records
   - Upsert key: Client Name + Project Title, filtered by Type = "SOW"

   When falling back to legacy "SOW Generator - Outputs": write Client Name, Output Path, Options Count, Recommended Option, Generated At.

   If Notion CLI is unavailable, skip silently — do not block output.

## Key Behaviors

- Always name packages descriptively (e.g., Foundation Package, Growth Package, Transformation Package). The Option A / B / C labels are retained for structure but each must also carry a descriptive package name.
- The comparison table must lead with Scope, not Price. Clients who see price first anchor on lowest cost and ignore fit. Scope first lets the client choose by outcome, then validate the investment.
- Apply client priorities to adjust dimension weights: a reliability-focused client warrants risk weighted at 70/30; a budget-focused client warrants pricing weighted at 60/40. Always state the weighting used and why in the scoring matrix section before presenting the final SOW.
- Output is always Markdown. Do not generate DOCX directly. The client or user converts to DOCX, PDF, or other formats as needed.
- Notion: if Notion CLI is configured, write to the consolidated "[FOS] Deliverables" database with Type="SOW", including Company + Deal relations. Fall back to "Founder OS HQ - Deliverables", then legacy "SOW Generator - Outputs" if not found. Do NOT lazy-create any database.
- Each option section must be entirely self-contained. A reader viewing only Option B should understand the full engagement scope, timeline, investment, and terms without cross-referencing Options A or C.

## Output

The final synthesized SOW document written to the output file, structured as follows per the sow-writing skill:

```markdown
# Statement of Work: [Project Name]
[Client Name] x [Provider Name] | [Date]

---

## Executive Summary

---

## Option C: [Descriptive Package Name]
[Full Standard SOW Sections — identical structure to Option A]

---

## Provider Recommendation

[1 paragraph: identify the recommended option and explain why, grounding the recommendation in the client's stated priorities from the brief — budget sensitivity, timeline urgency, growth ambitions, or risk tolerance. If the scoring matrix was overridden due to client priorities, state the override and reasoning. Do not recommend based on revenue to the provider. Reference the weighted scoring matrix result and name the weights applied.]
```

## Error Handling

- **Only 2 proposals received**: Present 2 options. Name them as Option A and Option B; do not reference a missing Option C. Add a note in the Provider Recommendation: "A third scope option was not available in this run. The two options presented represent the full range evaluated." Proceed normally with 2-option scoring matrix.
- **Risk and pricing analyses disagree** (e.g., risk favors conservative but pricing favors balanced): Present both analyses transparently. Let the scoring matrix resolve via weighted totals. In the Provider Recommendation, name the disagreement explicitly and explain how the client's stated priorities drove the final weight selection.
- **All proposals exceed budget**: Present all three options. Do not suppress any option. In the comparison table, mark each over-budget option's Investment cell with "(exceeds stated budget)". For each option, add a scope-cut recommendation in the Out of Scope section: "To reduce investment to $[budget], remove [deliverable] — estimated saving: $[amount]."
- **Scoring tie** (weighted totals within 0.5 of each other): Prefer the option that best aligns with the client's stated priorities. If no priority is stated, prefer the balanced (middle) option. Document the tie and the tiebreaker rationale in the Provider Recommendation.

## Examples

<example>
<user>Synthesize SOW for Acme Corp's customer portal project. Three proposals received from scope agents. Risk and pricing evaluations complete. Client priorities: On-time delivery, Budget predictability. Output to default path.</user>
<assistant>
Collecting proposals and analyses...

All three proposals received (conservative, balanced, ambitious). Both risk and pricing analyses present.

**Client priorities detected**: "On-time delivery", "Budget predictability" → reliability-focused client. Applying 70/30 weighting (risk 70%, pricing 30%).

**Building scoring matrix:**

| Option       | Risk Score (×0.70) | Pricing Score (×0.30) | Weighted Total |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Conservative | 8.2 × 0.70 = 5.74  | 8.5 × 0.30 = 2.55     | 8.29           |
| Balanced     | 7.4 × 0.70 = 5.18  | 9.0 × 0.30 = 2.70     | 7.88           |
| Ambitious    | 5.8 × 0.70 = 4.06  | 5.5 × 0.30 = 1.65     | 5.71           |

**Recommended option**: Conservative (weighted total 8.29). Highest score aligns directly with stated priorities — reliability-focused clients weighting risk at 70% should receive the lowest-risk option. No override required.

**Naming packages** (avoiding Conservative / Balanced / Ambitious labels):
- Option A (Conservative) → **Foundation Package**
- Option B (Balanced) → **Growth Package**
- Option C (Ambitious) → **Transformation Package**

Writing full three-option SOW document...

Document structure:
- Executive Summary: Acme Corp customer portal context, three packages follow
- Option Comparison table: leads with Scope row, Investment fourth, ✓ Recommended on Foundation Package column
- Option A: Foundation Package — full 10-section SOW (248 hrs, 10 weeks, $42,857)
- Option B: Growth Package — full 10-section SOW (398 hrs, 12 weeks, $56,667)
- Option C: Transformation Package — full 10-section SOW (620 hrs, 14 weeks, $71,875)
- Provider Recommendation: Foundation Package recommended given stated priorities of on-time delivery and budget predictability; scoring matrix confirmed at 70/30 risk/pricing weighting; weighted score 8.29 vs 7.88 for Growth Package.

<example>
<user>Synthesize SOW for Meridian Health's patient intake system. Client has stated price sensitivity as the primary concern. Balanced and ambitious proposals present; conservative proposal not received this run.</user>
<assistant>
Collecting proposals and analyses...

Only 2 proposals received (balanced, ambitious). Conservative proposal missing. Proceeding with 2-option synthesis; will note the gap in Provider Recommendation.

**Client priorities detected**: "price sensitivity" → budget-focused client. Applying 60/40 weighting (pricing 60%, risk 40%).

**Building scoring matrix (2 options):**

| Option    | Risk Score (×0.40) | Pricing Score (×0.60) | Weighted Total |
|-----------|--------------------|-----------------------|----------------|
| Balanced  | 7.4 × 0.40 = 2.96  | 9.0 × 0.60 = 5.40     | 8.36           |
| Ambitious | 5.8 × 0.40 = 2.32  | 5.5 × 0.60 = 3.30     | 5.62           |

**Recommended option**: Balanced (weighted total 8.36). For a price-sensitive client, the pricing dimension carries 60% weight. Balanced scores 9.0 on pricing versus 5.5 for ambitious, making balanced the clear winner even before the risk dimension is applied. Ambitious also exceeds the stated budget by 44% — this would require a scope renegotiation conversation before sign-off.

**Naming packages:**
- Option A (Balanced) → **Core Implementation Package**
- Option B (Ambitious) → **Full-Scope Package**

Writing two-option SOW document...

Document structure:
- Executive Summary: Meridian Health patient intake system context, two packages evaluated
- Option Comparison table: Scope leads, Investment fourth, ✓ Recommended on Core Implementation Package
- Option A: Core Implementation Package — full 10-section SOW (398 hrs, 12 weeks, $56,667 — within budget range)
- Option B: Full-Scope Package — full 10-section SOW (620 hrs, 14 weeks, $71,875 — exceeds stated budget; investment cell marked "(exceeds stated budget)"; scope-cut recommendations added in Out of Scope section)
- Provider Recommendation: Core Implementation Package recommended. Client's stated price sensitivity drove 60/40 pricing/risk weighting. Weighted score 8.36 vs 5.62 for Full-Scope Package. Full-Scope Package is viable with a budget conversation but requires scope reduction to fit within constraints — specific scope-cut options documented in Option B's Out of Scope section. Note: a third conservative scope option was not available in this run; the two options presented represent the full range evaluated.
