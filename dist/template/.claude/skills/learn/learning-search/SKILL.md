# Learning Search

Query, filter, and browse past learnings from the Learnings Notion database. Used by: `/founder-os:learn:search`.

## Purpose and Context

Provide fast, relevant access to previously captured learnings. Support filtering by topic, keyword, date range, and source type. Return ranked results with related-insight cross-references for each match. This skill operates in read-only mode against the discovered Learnings database (see Notion Database Access below).

---

## Notion Database Access

**Database name**: Search for `[FOS] Learnings` first, then fall back to `Founder OS HQ - Learnings`, then `Learning Log Tracker - Learnings`.

Read-only access. Search the workspace for a database titled "[FOS] Learnings". If not found, try "Founder OS HQ - Learnings". If not found, fall back to "Learning Log Tracker - Learnings". If none exists, report that no learnings have been logged yet and suggest using `/founder-os:learn:log` to start.

### Schema Reference

| Property | Type | Used in Search |
|----------|------|---------------|
| Title | title | Text search, display |
| Insight | rich_text | Text search, display |
| Topics | multi_select | Topic filter, display |
| Source Type | select | Source filter |
| Context | rich_text | Text search |
| Related IDs | rich_text | Cross-reference lookup |
| Related Titles | rich_text | Display |
| Week | rich_text | Date-range filter |
| Logged At | date | Date-range filter, sort, display |

## Filter Pipeline

Apply filters in this fixed order: **topic → date → keyword**. Each filter narrows the result set for the next.

### 1. Topic Filter

If the positional argument or `--topic` flag specifies a topic name, filter to entries where `Topics` contains the specified topic (case-insensitive match). Accept partial matches: "tech" matches "Technical".

If the positional argument looks like a general search term rather than a topic name (not matching any of the 10 predefined topics), skip this filter and treat it as a keyword instead.

### 2. Date Filter

If `--since=Nd` or `--since=YYYY-MM-DD` is specified, filter to entries where `Logged At` is on or after the resolved date.

- `--since=7d` → last 7 days from today
- `--since=30d` → last 30 days
- `--since=2026-01-15` → on or after January 15, 2026
- Default when no `--since` flag: no date filter (return all time)

### 3. Keyword Filter

If a keyword is provided (either as the positional argument when not matching a topic, or via additional text), filter to entries where `Title`, `Insight`, or `Context` contains the keyword string. Apply case-insensitive substring matching.

---

## Result Ranking

After filtering, rank results using a composite relevance score. Calculate the score for each result by summing these points:

| Signal | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Keyword match in Title | +3 |
| Keyword match in Insight | +2 |
| Keyword match in Context | +1 |
| Exact topic match (topic filter active) | +2 |
| Recency: logged in last 7 days | +1 |
| Recency: logged more than 90 days ago | -1 |

Sort results by composite score descending. Tiebreak by `Logged At` descending (most recent first).

---

## Display Format

Present results as a numbered list with topic emoji tags and key metadata:

```
### 🔍 Learning Search Results

**Query**: [search terms] | **Filters**: [active filters] | **Results**: N found

1. 📘 **[Title]** — Technical, Process
   _[First 120 chars of Insight text]..._
   📅 [Logged At date] | Source: [Source Type]
   🔗 Related: [Related Titles or "none"]

2. 💡 **[Title]** — Idea, Business
   _[First 120 chars of Insight text]..._
   📅 [Logged At date] | Source: [Source Type]
   🔗 Related: [Related Titles or "none"]
```

### Topic Emoji Mapping

| Topic | Emoji |
|-------|-------|
| Technical | 📘 |
| Process | ⚙️ |
| Business | 💼 |
| People | 👥 |
| Tool | 🔧 |
| Strategy | 🎯 |
| Mistake | ⚠️ |
| Win | 🏆 |
| Idea | 💡 |
| Industry | 🌐 |

Use the emoji of the first topic in the entry's Topics list as the leading icon.

## Result Limit

Default: 10 results. Override with `--limit=N`. Maximum: 50 results per query. If more results exist beyond the limit, note the total count and suggest narrowing the search.

---

## Related Insights in Search Results

For each search result, display the `Related Titles` value if non-empty. This provides cross-referencing without additional database queries. If `Related Titles` is empty, display "none".

---

## Empty Results Handling

When no results match the query:

1. Report the active filters clearly: "No learnings found matching [query] with filters [topic/date/keyword]."
2. Suggest broadening the search:
   - Remove the date filter if `--since` is active
   - Try related topic names (e.g., "Try 'Process' instead of 'workflow'")
   - Use a shorter keyword
3. Show the total count of learnings in the database for context: "Your learning log contains N entries total."

---

## Edge Cases

### Database Not Found
If none of the `[FOS] Learnings`, `Founder OS HQ - Learnings`, or `Learning Log Tracker - Learnings` databases exists, report clearly: "No learning log found. Use `/founder-os:learn:log` to capture your first learning." Do not create the database on read operations.

### Notion Unavailable
Report the connection error and suggest retrying. Do not fabricate search results.

### Ambiguous Positional Argument
When the first argument could be either a topic name or a keyword (e.g., "process" matches the Process topic but could also be a keyword), prioritize topic matching. If the user seems to want keyword search instead, suggest using `--topic=none` or rephrasing.

### Very Broad Queries
For queries with no topic filter, no date filter, and a single common word as keyword, warn that results may be broad and suggest adding a topic or date filter.
