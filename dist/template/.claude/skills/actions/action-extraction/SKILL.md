## Overview

Analyze text content from meeting transcripts, email threads, or documents to extract structured action items. Convert every detected action into a task containing a title, description, owner, deadline, priority, source type, and source title. Process the text systematically: detect the source type, scan for actionable verb patterns, infer ownership, parse deadlines, assign priority, and check for duplicates before creating Notion tasks.

## Source Type Detection

Identify the source type from content patterns before extraction begins:

**Meeting Transcript** — Contains speaker labels (`Speaker 1:`, `John:`), timestamps (`[00:15:30]`), turn-taking patterns, or keywords like "meeting notes", "transcript", "minutes". Look for action-assignment patterns: "AI:", "Action Item:", "Next steps:", "[Name] to...", "[Name] will...".

**Email** — Contains header patterns (`From:`, `To:`, `Subject:`, `Date:`), forwarding markers (`---------- Forwarded message ----------`), reply chains (`On [date], [person] wrote:`), or signature blocks. Process the most recent message first; earlier messages may contain resolved items.

**Document** — General text without transcript or email markers. May contain structured lists, headings, bullet points, or task-oriented sections. Treat any actionable language as a candidate.

**Other** — When no clear pattern matches, default to "Other" and apply general extraction rules.

## Actionable Verb Patterns

Scan text in three passes — one per category — and collect all matches before deduplicating.

### Direct Requests (Highest Signal)

Strong indicators of an action item. Extract immediately upon detection:

- "Review [X]", "Approve [X]", "Sign [document]"
- "Send [item] to [person]", "Forward [X] to [recipient]"
- "Schedule [meeting/call]", "Set up [X]", "Book [time/room]"
- "Complete [task]", "Finish [item]", "Submit [deliverable]"
- "Update [document/status]", "Revise [item]", "Edit [document]"
- "Pay [invoice/bill]", "Process [payment/expense]"
- "Create [document/report/plan]", "Draft [response/proposal]"
- "Confirm [attendance/details]", "Verify [information]"
- "Share [document/access] with [person]", "Grant [permission]"
- "Cancel [meeting/subscription]", "Remove [item/access]"

### Implicit Actions (Medium Signal)

Polite or indirect phrasing concealing genuine requests. Convert to an explicit action verb:

- "Can you...?", "Could you...?", "Would you mind...?" — extract the verb following the modal.
- "Please [verb]...", "Kindly [verb]..." — extract the verb directly.
- "I need you to...", "We need...", "It would be great if..." — extract the clause following the setup phrase.
- "Let me know about...", "Get back to me on..." — convert to "Respond about [topic]" or "Provide update on [topic]".
- "Any thoughts on...?" — convert to "Review and provide feedback on [topic]".

When an implicit action lacks a clear verb, default to "Follow up on [topic]".

### Commitment Language (Self-Assigned Actions)

Promises or commitments that represent obligations:

- "I will...", "I'll...", "I can...", "I'm going to..."
- "Let me...", "Allow me to..."
- "I'll follow up on...", "I'll get back to you about..."
- "Consider it done", "I'm on it" — extract the referenced task from surrounding context.

### Transcript-Specific Patterns

For meeting transcripts, also detect:

- "AI:" or "Action Item:" prefixes followed by task descriptions
- "[Name] to [verb]..." or "[Name] will [verb]..." delegation patterns
- "Next steps:" sections — treat each bullet/item as a separate action
- "Takeaway:" or "Follow-up:" markers
- "[Name], can you take [task]?" — explicit delegation during discussion

## Action Item Structure

Produce one structured object per detected action:

- **title**: Verb-first, imperative form, max 80 characters. Good: "Review Q4 budget proposal". Bad: "Budget proposal".
- **description**: Full context including who made the request, what is needed, why it matters, and any constraints. Quote key phrases from the source when they add specificity.
- **owner**: Assign using the Owner Inference Rules below. Use `"user"` for the current user. Use the person's name for others.
- **deadline**: ISO date string (YYYY-MM-DD) or `null`. Apply Deadline Parsing rules.
- **priority**: Score 1-5. Infer from urgency language, deadline proximity, and context (5 = critical, 1 = low).
- **source_type**: One of "Meeting Transcript", "Email", "Document", or "Other".
- **source_title**: Title of the source — meeting subject, email subject line, or document title. Extract from content headers or use first meaningful line.
- **context**: Brief reference string under 120 characters. Format varies by source type: "Meeting: [title] | [date]" or "From: [sender] | Subject: [line]" or "Document: [title]".

## Owner Inference Rules

Evaluate in order. Stop at the first match:

1. **Explicit @mention**: Text contains "@[name]" or "[name]:" followed by a task assignment. Assign owner to that person.
2. **Named delegation**: "[Name] to [verb]...", "Have [name] handle...", "[Name] will take care of...". Assign owner to the named person.
3. **Direct request to user**: In emails addressed TO the user containing a request. Assign `owner: "user"`.
4. **Team references**: "The team should...", "Engineering needs to...". Assign `owner: "user"` and add note: "Requires delegation — assign to appropriate team member."
5. **Self-commitments**: "I will...", "I'll..." or equivalent. Assign `owner: "user"`.
6. **Ambiguous ownership**: Default to `owner: "user"`. Add to description: "Owner unclear from context — verify assignment."

Never leave the owner field empty. Every action item must have an assigned owner.

## Deadline Parsing

### Explicit Dates

Parse any recognizable date format: "January 15, 2025", "Jan 15", "1/15/2025", "2025-01-15", "next Monday", "this Thursday", "the 15th", "by the 20th". Convert all to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD). When only a day is mentioned without a month, assume the next future occurrence.

### Urgency Language

Convert urgency phrases to concrete dates relative to the current date:

| Phrase | Deadline |
|--------|----------|
| "ASAP", "immediately", "urgent" | Today |
| "today", "EOD", "COB" | Today |
| "tomorrow", "first thing tomorrow" | Tomorrow |
| "this week", "EOW", "before the weekend" | Coming Friday |
| "next week", "early next week" | Next Monday |
| "end of month", "EOM" | Last day of current month |
| "in [N] days" | Today + N days |
| "in [N] weeks" | Today + N*7 days |

### No Deadline

When no temporal language appears: set `deadline: null`. Append to description: "No deadline specified — set manually based on priority."

Never fabricate a deadline. Only assign a date when text provides explicit or implicit temporal information.

## Priority Scoring

Assign priority 1-5 based on these signals:

- **5 (Critical)**: Explicit urgency ("ASAP", "urgent", "critical"), same-day deadline, escalation language
- **4 (High)**: Deadline within 2 days, senior stakeholder requests, blocking other work
- **3 (Medium)**: Deadline within 1 week, standard requests, routine tasks with clear owners
- **2 (Low)**: Deadline beyond 1 week, nice-to-have items, informational follow-ups
- **1 (Backlog)**: No deadline, vague requests ("let's circle back"), optional items

When multiple signals conflict, use the highest priority indicator.

## Duplicate Detection

Before creating a Notion task, check for existing duplicates:

- Query the "[FOS] Tasks" database for tasks with similar titles created within the past 14 days. **Filter by `Type = "Action Item"`** to avoid false positives against Follow-Ups or Email Tasks from other plugins.
- **Duplicate**: Same primary verb AND same core noun phrase. Example: "Review Q4 budget" and "Review the Q4 budget proposal" are duplicates. Skip creation and note: "Duplicate detected — existing task [task_id]."
- **Near-duplicate**: Same noun, different verb. Example: "Review Q4 budget" vs "Approve Q4 budget". Create the new task but add cross-reference: "Related task: [task_id]."
- Never delete or modify existing tasks during duplicate detection. This check is read-only.

## Multiple Actions Per Source

- Extract every distinct action. Do not merge related but separate tasks.
- Assign each action its own unique title differentiated by verb and object.
- Share the same `source_type`, `source_title`, and `context` across items from one source.
- When the source contains a numbered or bulleted list of tasks, treat each item as a separate action.
- Preserve extraction order — list items in the order they appear.

## Edge Cases

- **Vague requests** ("Let's circle back", "We should catch up"): Create "Follow up on [topic]" with `deadline: null` and priority 1. Add: "Vague request — clarify scope and timeline."
- **Conditional actions** ("If the client approves, then send the contract"): Note the condition in description. Reduce priority by 1 (minimum 1).
- **Recurring tasks** ("Send weekly report every Friday"): Create one action for the next occurrence. Add: "Recurring task — consider automation."
- **No actions found**: Report clearly: "No action items detected in the provided text." Do not fabricate items.
- **Empty input**: Halt with: "No text provided. Paste content or provide a file path."

## Notion Task Creation

1. **Database discovery**: Search Notion for a database named "[FOS] Tasks". If not found, try "Founder OS HQ - Tasks". If not found, fall back to the legacy name "Action Item Extractor - Tasks". If none is found, skip Notion storage and use graceful degradation (see below). Do NOT create the database — the HQ database is provisioned by the Notion HQ setup process.
2. **Set required columns**: For every task created, set:
   - `Type` = "Action Item"
   - `Source Plugin` = "Action Extractor"
   - All other properties: Title, Description, Owner, Deadline, Priority, Status ("To Do"), Source Type, Source Title, Extracted At (current timestamp).
3. **Company/Contact relation**: When the owner can be matched to a CRM contact, populate the `Contact` relation. If a matching company is found via the contact's company or email domain, populate the `Company` relation. To match, search the "[FOS] Contacts" database by owner name (case-insensitive). If no match is found, leave both relations empty — never error on a failed CRM lookup.
4. After creating tasks, display results with Notion page links.

## Graceful Degradation

If Notion CLI is unavailable, output extracted action items as structured text in chat. Include all fields. Warn: "Notion unavailable — displaying results in chat. Tasks were not saved to Notion."
