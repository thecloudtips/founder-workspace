description: Seed data of known fallback paths for all 30 Founder OS plugins. Used by the self-healing module when a data source is classified as degradable.
---

## Overview

The fallback registry maps known failure modes to graceful degradation paths. This is seed data — the learning system extends it over time based on which fallbacks users accept vs reject.

## Universal Fallbacks (All Plugins)

| Failure | Fallback | Output Note |
|---|---|---|
| Notion DB not found | Apply 3-step discovery (search "[FOS] Name" → "Founder OS HQ - Name" → legacy name). If all fail, output to local file instead. | "Notion output saved to local file — sync manually when available" |
| Notion API rate limited | Retry with backoff (handled by transient classification). If exhausted, queue output for next run. | "Notion rate limited — output queued for next run" |
| gws CLI not installed | Skip all Google data sources | "Google Workspace data unavailable — install gws CLI" |
| gws auth expired | Prompt user to re-authenticate | "Google auth expired — run 'gws auth login' to reconnect" |

## Extending the Registry

The self-healing learning system extends this registry by:
1. Tracking which fallbacks users accept (no re-run after degraded output)
2. Tracking which fallbacks users reject (re-run or complaint after degraded output)
3. Promoting successful new recovery paths discovered by user overrides
4. Demoting fallbacks with low acceptance rates
